- Headline font: 'Poppins' (sans-serif) for titles, offering a clean and modern aesthetic. Body Font: 'Inter' (sans-serif) for readability and a neutral tone.
- Nautical-themed icons (anchor, ship wheel, compass) for navigation and section headers, reinforcing the ship theme.
- Fixed navigation bar at the top with a transparent background, giving the impression of a ship's control panel. Hero section with a prominent introduction and call-to-action buttons styled as 'mission points'.
